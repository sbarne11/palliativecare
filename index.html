	<p>Welcome to our online learning resource aimed at undergraduate nursing students. You will explore three interactive scenarios that focus on the fundamental nursing-care-skills that undergraduate nursing students require when caring for patients and their family's receiving palliative, and end-of-life care. The aim is for you to learn and reflect on your participation in patient care during these scenarios relative to palliative and end-of-life care, ultimately ensuring patients and their families receive the care they deserve</p></div>
